const Transaction = require('../models/Transaction');
const User = require('../models/User');

// @desc    Get all transactions
// @route   GET /api/transactions
router = require('express').Router(); // This file exports logic but for simplicity I will just rewrite logic inside routes usually, but let's stick to controller pattern effectively.
// Wait, the routes file required this. Let's fix routes too.
// Actually, `routes/transactions.js` had the logic inline. I need to update `routes/transactions.js` directly.
